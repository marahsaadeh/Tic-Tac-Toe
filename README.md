# Tic-Tac-Toe

**Tic-Tac-Toe Console Application - Dart Assessment**

**Task Description:**

Develop a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Dart. The game should allow two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The application should provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

**Requirements:**

* **Game Board:**
    1.  Implement a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
    2.  Display the current state of the board after each move.

* **Players:**
    1.  Allow two players to take turns, one representing 'X' and the other 'O'.
    2.  Prompt players to input their moves using the console.

* **Input Validation:**
    1.  Validate user inputs to ensure they are within the valid range (1-9) and correspond to an empty cell on the board.
    2.  Display an error message for invalid inputs and prompt the player to enter a valid move.
       
* **Winning Conditions:**
    1.  Determine and check for winning conditions after each move.
    2.  Declare the winner if there are three consecutive 'X' or 'O' markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
    3.  End the game if a winner is declared.

* **Draw Condition:**
    1.  Declare the game as a draw if all cells are filled, and no player has achieved a winning condition.

* **Game Loop:**
    1.  Implement a loop to allow the game to continue until there is a winner or a draw.
    2.  Provide an option to restart the game after it concludes.

* **Code Structure:**
    1.  Organize your code into functions or classes to enhance readability and maintainability.
    2.  Use proper naming conventions for variables and functions.

* **Documentation:**
    1.  Include comments or documentation within your code to explain the logic and functionality.

* **Bonus (Just a bonus, don't hesitate yourself if you can't):**
    1.  Implement a simple AI opponent to play against the human player.
    2.  Allow players to choose their markers ('X' or 'O') at the beginning of the game.

This task is designed to assess your proficiency in Dart programming, user input handling, and basic game logic implementation. Good luck!
